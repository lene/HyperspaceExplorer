HyperspaceExplorer Changelog
=============================

release 0.7.1:
    * Based Functions on FunctionValueGrid, Objects on VertexGrid
    * Added multithreaded Transformations

release 0.7.0:
    * Added Rotopes to the function menu. Only Extrusion, Tapering and Rotation
      are currently supported.
    * Started a test suite. as of now the following classes are tested:
        * VecMath::Vector, VecMath::Matrix, VecMath::Rotation and
          VecMath::NestedVector
        * Realm and several Rotopes
        * RealFunction (incompletely)

release 0.6.4:
    * accelerated xyz -> RGB color manager by getting rid of std::map<>
    * make code compile with gcc 4.3.3

release 0.6.3:
    * Color management works now. Unfortunately, it seems to cause a major
      performance hit on 4-dimensional transformations. Haven't investigated
      that yet.
    * Developed Rotopes. Rotopes are objects that are created from an object
      of lower dimension by extrusions, taper operations and rotations.
      Currently, only extruding and tapering works.
      * Worked on N-dimensional rotations as parameters for objects of a
        dimension higher than 4.
    * Cleaned up the Balls code, but haven't integrated it yet.

release 0.6.2:
    * Separated a lot of code out of C4DView into the interface View and the
      class ViewImpl. Cleaned up dependencies of Menu4D and MouseHandler on
      C4DView.
    * Renamed many of the member variables so that they begin with a "_".
      This is the new naming convention for members, which will eventually be
      implemented throughout the whole code.
    * Added the project Balls (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bounce-balls/)
      into the codebase. Haven't connected it to Hyperspace Explorer yet.
    * Added the testing code for LSystems into the codebase. Not doing anything
      with it yet either.
    * Created a subsystem to generate n-dimensional Rotopes
      (http://teamikaria.com/wiki/Rotope). Practically, this only creates a
      tesseract right now.
    * Added a lot of doxygen documentation.

release 0.6.1:
    * updated the documentation (online help)
    * fixed bug in qmakefile that prevented the documentation from being
      installed correctly

release 0.6.0:
    * added capability to read scripts
    * added adjustable background color
    * cleaned up more code
        * made all Transformations consist of Rotation<>s and Vector<>s

release 0.5.0:
    * developed a framework to assign generic parameters (of arbitrary type) to
      any function and control them from a dialog window
    * replaced all arrays with std::vector<>'s
    * transparence and saving the rendered images as PNG files are official
      functions now

release 0.4.0:
    * rendering to images is possible now
    * replaced all possible #ifdef DEBUG statements to use SingletonLog
    * refactored custom function dialogs to move as much code as possible to
      PluginCreator
    * functions have a name and a list of parameter names as attributes
    * slots to select functions from menu are programmed more cleanly now with a
      templated function (so to speak - a class template with a static member
      function in fact)
    * custom functions work again (almost - complex functions still crash)
    2008-03-19

release 0.3.2:
    * added a menu bar and a status bar
    * checking of menu items works correctly now
    * cleaned up the code using namespaces and a singleton instead of global variables
    2008-03-13

release 0.3.1:
	* fixed bug that caused recursive fractals to need to be re-selected in
	the menu to change parameters
	* fixed online help (preliminarily)
	* created a structured source tree
    2008-02-25

	place in ~/.HyperspaceExplorer
	DONE, 2004-04-20
	* make dist now works
	DONE, 2004-04-20
