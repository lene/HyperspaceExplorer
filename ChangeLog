HyperspaceExplorer Changelog
=============================

release 0.5.0:
    * developed a framework to assign generic parameters (of arbitrary type) to
      any function and control them from a dialog window
    * replaced all arrays with std::vector<>'s
    * transparence and saving the rendered images as PNG files are official
      functions now

release 0.4.0:
    * rendering to images is possible now
    * replaced all possible #ifdef DEBUG statements to use SingletonLog
    * refactored custom function dialogs to move as much code as possible to
      PluginCreator
    * functions have a name and a list of parameter names as attributes
    * slots to select functions from menu are programmed more cleanly now with a
      templated function (so to speak - a class template with a static member
      function in fact)
    * custom functions work again (almost - complex functions still crash)

release 0.3.2:
    * added a menu bar and a status bar
    * checking of menu items works correctly now
