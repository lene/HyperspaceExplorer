HyperspaceExplorer
==================

Displays four-dimensional objects and functions by projecting them into three-dimensional space. Viewpoint transformations and parameter changes are displayed in real time.

Build with:

$ qmake && make

The program is quite immature at the moment. Expect to run into problems. Especially the documentation is in a sorry state, as you can see in this README.
