    <a name="Introduction" /><h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div align="justify">
      <p>Just as you can define objects in three-dimensional space, you can
define objects with four dimensions. And just as three-dimensional
objects can be projected onto a plane, four-dimensional objects can be
projected into three-space.</p>
      <p>This program uses this approach to acquaint you with a couple of
four-dimensional objects. Four-dimensional objects are projected to
three dimensions, and then displayed on the computer monitor (after a
further projection to two dimensions).</p>
      <p>Every object thus has a is viewed from a viewpoint in four
dimensions, as well as a viewpoint in three dimensions. That leaves
freedom for plenty of viewing transformations. You can translate and
rotate what is displayed in three and four dimensions, to get a better
feeling for the objects and for four-space manipulations.</p>
      <p>when you start this program, you will see nothing spectacular,
just a colorful cube on the screen. The purpose of this document is to
enable you to see what the four dimensional structure of this cube is,
and to explore many other four dimensional objects. </p>

    <a name="Object_Manipulation" /><h2>Object translation/rotation with the mouse and modifier keys</h2>
You manipulate the displayed object pressing a mouse button, optionally
holding a modifier key, and dragging the mouse.<br>
LMB stands for left mouse button, MMB for middle mouse button, RMB for
right mouse button. <br>

note that rotating about the xy-plane, the xz-plane and the yz-plane in
four-space is the same as rotating about z-axis, y-axis and x-axis in
three-space.<br>
<br>
With a double click you can restore all transforms in four-space back
to original values.<br>
<br>
If you press the ALT key while performing any of these transforms, your
mouse movement is taken as an indication of how fast the object should
rotate, and an animation is started rotating the object about the given
axes/planes. You can indicate more than one direction, if you add
another movement after the animation has started.<br>
Double clicking stops the animation, as well as restoring the
four-dimensional transform.<br>
You can do almost everything, such as changing the display properties
or changing the displayed object, while the animation is running.<br>

<h2><a name="Menus"></a>The menus</h2>
<blockquote>
  <h3><a name="Object"></a>The "Object" submenu</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You select the four-dimensional object to be displayed with
the submenu titled "Object". There is a load of choices available.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h4><a name="fR3R"></a>The "f:R&sup3;-&gt;R" submenu</h4>
Under this menu you find a couple of three-dimensional "surspaces" in
four-space (just as there are two-dimensional surfaces in three-space).
These "surspaces" are described by functions of the type <br>
    <blockquote><u>x</u> = (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>w</i>)<br>
where <i>w </i>= f (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>)<br>
    </blockquote>
(up to now, only functions where <i>w</i> = f (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">r</span>), <span
 style="font-style: italic;">r</span> = sqrt (<i>x</i>&sup2;+<i>y</i>&sup2;+<i>z</i>&sup2;),&nbsp;
are implemented)<br>
    <br>
and of the type <br>
    <blockquote><u>x</u> = R&middot;(sin (<i>psi</i>)&middot;sin (<i>theta</i>)&middot;cos
(<i>phi</i>), sin (<i>psi</i>)&middot;sin (<i>theta</i>)&middot;sin (<i>phi</i>),
sin (<i>psi</i>)&middot;cos (<i>theta</i>), cos (<i>psi</i>))<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote> where R = f (<i>x, y, z</i>),<br>
    </blockquote>
in other words, four-dimensional polar functions.<br>
    <h4><a name="Objects"></a>The "Objects" submenu</h4>
Under this menu you find some four-dimensional objects. These objects
are generalizations of real objects from three-space, such as the cube,
the sphere or the tetrahedron.<br>
    <b><br>
Hypersphere:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four-dimensional version of a
circle or sphere, an object with a surface (or "surspace") which is the
same distance from the center in every point.<br>
    <b><br>
Hypercube:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
four-dimensional version of a cube. In 4D it has eight "surspaces", each
consisting of a cube.<br>
    <b><br>
Hyperpyramid:</b> The four-dimensional version of a tetrahedron or
four-sided pyramid. In 4D it has five "surspaces", each consisting of a
tetrahedron.<br>
    <b><br>
Menger Sponge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </b>The four-dimensional
relative of a Menger sponge. <br>
If you do not know what a Menger sponge is: A Menger sponge is a
fractal created by the following process. <br>
You take a cube and slice it into 27 (3x3x3) small cubes. <br>
Then you remove all subcubes which do not have an edge in common with
the original cube. In effect, you remove the cross-shaped interior of
the cube. <br>
Then you go ahead with this operation for all the subcubes which have
remained. <br>
And so on, ad infinitum.<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"> &nbsp;<img src="MengerSponge.png"
 title="A three-dimensional Menger sponge"
 alt="A three-dimensional Menger sponge"
 style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
A three-dimensional Menger sponge<br>
    <br>
    </div>
To the four-dimensional Menger sponge there are three parameters: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The level of the sponge, i.e. the number of times the
described process is repeated. For an actual fractal, the number would
be infinite. That, of course, cannot be done in our less-than-ideal,
CPU- and RAM-bound world. Do not set this above 3, unless you have a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">huge</span> machine and/or know exactly,
what you're doing. This number is of course an integer.</li>
      <li>The distance from the center, up to which hypercubes are
taken out of the surrounding cube. If you set this to 1, you get
something like a foam. At 2, you get the four-dimensional equivalent of
the sponge depicted and described above. Set to three, you get something
like dust, with the subcubes disconnected from each other.<br>
For higher values of distance, you can choose higher values of the
level too, before your computer gives up.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The size of the object.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Sierpinski Gasket:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The four-dimensional relative
of a Sierpinski Gasket.<br>
A Sierpinski gasket is similar in concept to a Menger sponge, but it
takes a tetrahedron as a basis.<br>
The four-dimensional Sierpinski gasket takes two parameters:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The level, defined as in the Menger sponge. With Sierpinski
gaskets, you can go a little higher on this, up to 6, say.</li>
      <li>The size of the object.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;<br>
Torus 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is more than one way to
generalize a torus from three to four dimensions. In three dimensions,
you create a torus by taking a circle with radius <span
 style="font-style: italic;">r</span>, and rotating it around another
center, in a second circle with radius <span style="font-style: italic;">R</span>.<br>
This generalization to four-space&nbsp; takes a circle of radius <i>rho</i>,
rotates it about a centre with a distance of <i>r</i> (defining a torus
in three dimensions), and rotates <em>that</em> about a centre in the
distance <i>R</i>.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Torus 2:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 4-torus is defined by rotating a
sphere of radius <i>r</i> about a centre in distance <i>R</i>.<br>
    <h4><a name="Surfaces"></a>The "Surfaces" submenu</h4>
Under this menu you find a couple of two-dimensional surfaces in
four-space, which are described by functions of the type <br>
    <blockquote><u>x</u> = <u>x</u> (<i>u, v</i>) and<br>
      <u>x</u> = <u>x</u> (<i>theta, phi</i>).<br>

  <h3><a name="Appearance"></a>The "Appearance" submenu</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>Colors</h4>
Coloration can be switched on or off. You usually want colors, as they
greatly aid you eye in understanding the spatial properties of the
displayed object. Turning off colors gives a slight performance
advantage. Colors are enabled by default.<br>
    <h4>Shading<br>
    </h4>
Shading means the smooth coloration from one point of the object to
another. You almost certainly want this, as everything looks awful
without it. Turning off shading gives a slight performance advantage.
Shading is enabled by default.<br>
    <h4>Depth Cue</h4>
Depth cue, also called fog, paints points which are further away from
the viewer in three-dimensional space darker. This greatly helps you to
understand the three-dimensional properties of an object. Turning it off
gives a slight performance advantage. Depth cue is enabled by default.<br>
    <div align="center"> <br>
    <img src="Hypercube.png" title="Depth cue on"
 alt="Depth cue on" style="width: 290px; height: 300px;"><br>

 alt="Depth cue off" style="width: 290px; height: 300px;"><br>
Depth cue off </div>
    <h4>4D Depth Cue</h4>
4D depth cue is the four-dimensional analogon to Depth cue, painting
points which are further away <span style="font-style: italic;">in
four-space</span> darker. Turning it off gives a moderate performance
advantage. It is disabled by default.
    <h4>Transparence / Line Antialiasing</h4>
Transparence is used when you view a solid object, Line AA is used when
viewing an object in wireframe. This makes an object look smoother and
thus "better". Turning it on incurs a huge performance hit, so it is
disabled by default.<br>
    <h4>Lighting</h4>
You can't turn off lighting, because without it everything would look
just flat and white. I don't even know why I left this menu point.<br>
    <h4>Wireframe / Solid</h4>
You can switch between wireframe display and solid display of an
object. The default is solid.<br>
    <div align="center"> <br>

 style="width: 290px; height: 300px;"><br>

    </div>
    <h4>Coordinate Cross<br>
    </h4>
You can display a coordinate cross to aid you in distinguishing which
direction is which axis. The x-axis is colored red, the y-axis green,
the z-axis blue and the w-axis purple.<br>
    <div align="center"> <br>

    <h4><a name="Benchmark"></a>Benchmark</h4>
Okay, this menu point <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
somewhat of a misnomer. What it does is rotating the current object in
the current display space first in four-space, then in three-space, and
then gives you the time it took and the framerate for each. <br>
Warning: this is not interruptible,and it may take quite a while,
depending on the object you display,the"Appearance" options you

  <h3>Grid Size and Bounds</h3>
You can enter the roughness of the grid at which the function values
are sampled. By default, functions are displayed on a 5x5x5 grid, which
is very inaccurate and looks rough. The drawback of a higher resolution
is, that the number of points sampled scales with the cube of the grid
size, so that for a grid that is twice as large, you'll have eight times
as many points as before, and the performance drops to one eigth.<br>
The bounds span the parameter space for the given function.<br>
For objects you find under the submenu "f:R&sup3;-&gt;R" you can
specify the grid in three dimensions (t, u, v), for objects from the
submenu "Surfaces" you need two (u and v), for  objects from the submenu
"Objects" you need none, as these are not sampled on a grid.<br>
  <h3>Function and Parameters</h3>
TBD.<br>

Notice that while changes on the "Grid Size and Bounds" part of the
window take effect immediately after you pressed the "Apply" button,
changes in the "Function and Parameters" part do not. In that case, you
first have to (re-)select the object or function you are setting the
parameters for.<br>
