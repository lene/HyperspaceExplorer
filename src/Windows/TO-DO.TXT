Hyperspace Explorer TO-DO											2000-11-23
=========================

 -	separation of the transformation / projection / drawing into a specialized	
	class - or make them a part of class Function, to make them overridable by	
	derived classes																DONE, 2000-11-30


 -	accelerate GL drawing - PROFILE! it is almost inconceivable that the 3D		
	drawing takes as long as the 4D transformations								

 -	multithreaded 4D transform, projection and (maybe) drawing					


 -	more (and more flexible) functions											
	 +	morphing between functions												
	 +	animated parameter values												
	 +  hypermengersponge														DONE, 2000-11-30

 -	implement surfaces in 4-space,												DONE, 2000-12-08
	as well as C -> C functions													
	+	Complex functions don't work because the c'tor calls the parent's 
		Initialize(), which doesn't call the descendant's g ()

 -  bodies in warped space														


 -	transparent polygons (the transparence simply doesn't work!)			

 -	better polygon drawing quality, especially: avoid drawing more than one		
	poly in one place															

 -	output to POV-ray															


 -	C4DDoc::[tuv]steps should depend on Function::tsteps, instead of			
	SpongeDlg::tsteps															

 -	usable (ie. showing all information), resizable and toggle-able statusbar	

 -	check for memory leaks, there should be thousands of them					
	+	Function::~Function () and Function::ReInit () and their descendants
