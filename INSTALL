Installation instructions for Hyperspace Explorer V0.6.1
========================================================

Source distribution
===================

Requirements:
Linux (*BSD should work, but is not tested yet) (Windows should work in theory)

Multithreaded Qt >= 4.0 <http://trolltech.com/products/qt>. I use Qt version 4.3
during development, so even if I don't use any features newer than 4.0 I cannot
guarantee that it will work with older versions of Qt.

OpenGL libraries and header files

Building the executable:
> tar jxf HyperspaceExplorer-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2
> cd HyperspaceExplorer
> qmake
> make
> sudo make install

HyperspaceExplorer is installed by default in /usr/local, the executable in
/usr/local/bin and the documentation and optional plugins in
/usr/local/share/HyperspaceExplorer. Current this behavior can only be
customized by editing the variable INSTALLDIR in the qmakefile src/src.pro.
