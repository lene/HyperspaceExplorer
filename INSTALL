Installation instructions for Hyperspace Explorer V0.1.9a
=========================================================

Source distribution
===================

Requirements:
Multithreaded Qt >= 4.0
OpenGL libraries and header files, MesaGL does fine

Building the executable:
> tar zxf HyperspaceExplorer.tar.gz
> cd HyperspaceExplorer
> qmake
> make
> make install

If any errors occur, you are on your own, this is still alpha code. You 
might drop me a line anyway, maybe I am able to help you, and I am highly 
interested in bug reports.

Running
=======

> cd HyperspaceExplorer
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.
> ./HyperspaceExplorer

You definitely should run the program from it's own directory if you want to
define your own functions, because it compiles them as dynamically loadable
libraries, which are compiled and stored from HyperspaceExplorer's current
working directory.

Contacting the author
=====================

email me: scout@hyperspace-travel.de. 
Tell me whatever you want about the program. If you find any interesting or 
nice-looking functions, send them to me as well. I'd like to include them with
the next version.
