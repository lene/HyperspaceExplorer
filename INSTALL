Installation instructions for Hyperspace Explorer V0.8.0
========================================================

Source distribution
===================

Requirements:
-------------
Linux (*BSD should work, but is not tested yet)

Multithreaded Qt >= 5.0 <http://trolltech.com/products/qt>. 

OpenGL libraries and header files

Building the executable:
------------------------
> tar jxf HyperspaceExplorer-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2
> cd HyperspaceExplorer
> qmake
> make
> sudo make install

HyperspaceExplorer is installed by default in /usr/local, the executable in
/usr/local/bin and the documentation and optional plugins in
/usr/local/share/HyperspaceExplorer. Current this behavior can only be
customized by editing the variable INSTALLDIR in the qmakefile src/src.pro.

Tell me whatever you want about the program. If you find any interesting or 
nice-looking functions, send them to me as well. I'd like to include them with
the next version.
