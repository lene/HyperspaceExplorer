TODO for finishing of Rotopes:

- store (n-1)-dimensional surfaces (as indices to the vertices) in uintvec<n-1>'s
  - find a representation for (n-1)-dimensional surfaces abstracted from uintvec<n>
- when performing a rotation, connect each vertex of a (n-1)-dimensional surface to its image after a rotation
  - do i have to perform that recursively, until i deal with lines? probably...
  - the operation should be done simply as surface::rotate()
  - generalize uintvec<D> to nested_vector<D, T>

- number of segments for rotations should be a parameter in function parameter dialog

- continue with "torations" - or generalize rotations so they can take displacement as a parameter
  - displacement should be a parameter too
