TODO for finishing of Rotopes:

- Matrix should have late binding so different algrithms for multiplication can be selected
  - test how much of a performance hit polymorphic Matrix multiplication is
  - move all creations of Matrix objects to a factory
  - replace operator notation with explicit function calls ;-(

- make the output function of Matrix, Vector, Rotation, NestedVector and whatnot conform to same interface

- write specializations for Vector, Rotation (and Matrix?) that get rid of the varargs c'tor

- combine vertex array with Realm to have a single class for surfaces without interdependence

- continue with "torations" - or generalize rotations so they can take displacement as a parameter
  - displacement should be a parameter too
