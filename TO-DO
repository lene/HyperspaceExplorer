=========================

Everything has moved to https://sourceforge.net/tracker, except for these items:

 - http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm
 - comment code
 - finish ValuesDialog integration

New Stuff:

 - GLObject: replace vararg constructor with template
 - all files where qt stuff is included as <q....h> instead of <Q...> is to be updated
 - split C4DView into smaller classes: Menu, control, view
 - find out where typedefs are appropriate; certainly in the Function modules (especially in ComplexFunction.H!)
 - Function.C: Delete -> template
 - QStringlist rcdirs into global config singleton
 - numclass -> Vector
 - mangled objects. especially sponge!
